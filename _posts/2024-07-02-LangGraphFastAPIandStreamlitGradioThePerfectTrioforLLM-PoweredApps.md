Before we delve into today's topic, a little heads up! 😊
This is the fifth installment of the LangChain beginner series. I'm chronicling my journey with GenAI in these posts (just so you know, I come from a civil engineering and machine learning background). Rest assured, I'll keep things easy for newcomers like myself, and we'll keep advancing with each new entry. Through this series, you'll gradually create your own GenAI application. Let's embrace this learning journey together! 🤗
